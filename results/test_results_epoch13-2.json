This means that 'A1' is the cell's address, and 'Year' is its content. Cells are separated by a vertical bar ('|'), like 'A1,Year|A2,Profit'. The cell content can be empty, resulting in cell data like 'A1,|A2,Profit'. If there are merged cells in the sheet, they are split into multiple cells and only the first cell will be filled with content, other cells will be left as blank. You can visualize the sheet data as a matrix of cells. Following the matrix, all the merged cells are provided in the format '<upper-left address>:<lower-right address>,' like 'A3:C3', with each line representing one merged cell.

The cell content can be empty, resulting in cell data like 'A1,|A2,Profit'. If there are merged cells in the sheet, they are split into multiple cells and only the first cell will be filled with content, other cells will be left as blank. You can visualize the sheet data as a matrix of cells. Following the matrix, all the merged cells are provided in the format '<upper-left address>:<lower-right address>,' like 'A3:C3', with each line representing one merged cell.

The cell content can be empty, resulting in cell data like 'A1,|A2,Profit'. If there are merged cells in the sheet, they are split into multiple cells and only the first cell will be filled with content, other cells will be left as blank. You can visualize the sheet data as a matrix of cells. Following the matrix, all the merged cells are provided in the format '<upper-left address>:<lower-right address>,' like 'A3:C3', with each line representing one merged cell.

The cell content can be empty, resulting in cell data like 'A1,|A2,Profit'. If there are merged cells in the sheet, they are split into multiple cells and only the first cell will be filled with content, other cells will be left as blank. You can visualize the sheet data as a matrix of cells. Following the matrix, all the merged cells are provided in the format '<upper-left address>:<lower-right address>,' like 'A3:C3', with each line representing one merged cell. Note if the answer is a merge cell, use the first cell address of the merge cell.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n<Sheet>\nA3,field of doctorate|B3,2001|C3,2003|D3,2006|E3,2008|F3,2010\nA4,|B4,number in labor force|C4,|D4,|E4,|F4,\nA5,all seh fields|B5,582500|C5,606300|D5,630300|E5,670200|F5,709700\nA6,biological, agricultural, and environmental life sciences|B6,142400|C6,148800|D6,158200|E6,167600|F6,179600\nA7,computer and information sciences|B7,10900|C7,12300|D7,13700|E7,16300|F7,19400\nA8,mathematics and statistics|B8,26300|C8,29000|D8,29500|E8,31200|F8,32500\nA9,physical sciences|B9,113200|C9,115700|D9,115800|E9,119900|F9,124400\nA10,psychology|B10,89600|C10,93000|D10,97500|E10,101000|F10,104200\nA11,social sciences|B11,77200|C11,79600|D11,81000|E11,85100|F11,88700\nA12,engineering|B12,101300|C12,104400|D12,108000|E12,119800|F12,129100\nA13,health|B13,21500|C13,23600|D13,26500|E13,29300|F13,31800\nA14,|B14,unemployment rate (percent)a|C14,|D14,|E14,|F14,\nA15,all seh fields|B15,1.3|C15,2.1|D15,1.4|E15,1.7|F15,2.4\nA16,biological, agricultural, and environmental life sciences|B16,1.1|C16,2|D16,1.4|E16,1.9|F16,2.2\nA17,computer and information sciences|B17,0.9|C17,2.4|D17,1.4|E17,1.2|F17,2.1\nA18,mathematics and statistics|B18,1.5|C18,2.4|D18,1|E18,1|F18,1.5\nA19,physical sciences|B19,1.7|C19,2.5|D19,2.1|E19,2.4|F19,3.5\nA20,psychology|B20,0.8|C20,1.7|D20,0.9|E20,1.3|F20,1.7\nA21,social sciences|B21,1.3|C21,1.5|D21,1|E21,1.3|F21,1.9\nA22,engineering|B22,1.7|C22,2.7|D22,1.4|E22,1.8|F22,2.8\nA23,health|B23,0.5|C23,1.3|D23,0.7|E23,1|F23,1.9\n<Merged Cells>B4:F4,B14:F14</Merged Cells></Sheet> Question:of the approximately 709,700 seh doctoral degree holders in the labor force in 2010, how many percent in social sciences?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The cell content can be empty, resulting in cell data like 'A1,|A2,Profit'. If there are merged cells in the sheet, they are split into multiple cells and only the first cell will be filled with content, other cells will be left as blank. You can visualize the sheet data as a matrix of cells. Following the matrix, all the merged cells are provided in the format '<upper-left address>:<lower-right address>,' like 'A3:C3', with each line representing one merged cell. Note if the answer is a merge cell, use the first cell address of the merge cell.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n<Sheet>\nA3,club|B3,season|C3,league|D3,|E3,fa cup|F3,|G3,league cup|H3,|I3,other|J3,|K3,total|L3,\nA4,|B4,|C4,app|D4,goals|E4,app|F4,goals|G4,app|H4,goals|I4,app|J4,goals|K4,app|L4,goals\nA5,shrewsbury town|B5,2002-2003|C5,30|D5,0|E5,1|F5,0|G5,1|H5,0|I5,0|J5,0|K5,32|L5,0\nA6,cardiff city|B6,2000-2002|C6,7|D6,0|E6,1|F6,0|G6,0|H6,0|I6,3|J6,0|K6,11|L6,0\nA7,tranmere rovers|B7,1997-2000|C7,95|D7,4|E7,6|F7,0|G7,14|H7,0|I7,0|J7,0|K7,115|L7,0\nA8,wolverhampton wanderers|B8,1986-1997|C8,376|D8,43|E8,20|F8,1|G8,22|H8,0|I8,33|J8,1|K8,451|L8,45\nA9,west bromwich albion|B9,1985-1986|C9,24|D9,1|E9,2|F9,0|G9,1|H9,0|I9,2|J9,0|K9,29|L9,1\nA10,total|B10,|C10,532|D10,48|E10,30|F10,1|G10,38|H10,0|I10,38|J10,1|K10,638|L10,50\n<Merged Cells>G3:H3,K3:L3,B3:B4,I3:J3,A3:A4,C3:D3,E3:F3</Merged Cells></Sheet> Question:in 1997, how many appearances did andy thompson join tranmere rovers, after making a total of appearances?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The cell content can be empty, resulting in cell data like 'A1,|A2,Profit'. If there are merged cells in the sheet, they are split into multiple cells and only the first cell will be filled with content, other cells will be left as blank. You can visualize the sheet data as a matrix of cells. Following the matrix, all the merged cells are provided in the format '<upper-left address>:<lower-right address>,' like 'A3:C3', with each line representing one merged cell. Note if the answer is a merge cell, use the first cell address of the merge cell.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n<Sheet>\nA3,|B3,total - new brunswick|C3,|D3,|E3,north of the province|F3,|G3,|H3,south-east of the province|I3,|J3,\nA4,|B4,present in 2011|C4,expected in 2011|D4,difference|E4,present in 2011|F4,expected in 2011|G4,difference|H4,present in 2011|I4,expected in 2011|J4,difference\nA5,|B5,numbers|C5,|D5,|E5,|F5,|G5,|H5,|I5,|J5,\nA6,total - health care professionals|B6,15,525|C6,13,690|D6,1,835|E6,6,970|F6,6,465|G6,505|H6,5,595|I6,4,705|J6,890\nA7,registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses|B7,4,260|C7,3,935|D7,325|E7,1,905|F7,1,970|G7,-65|H7,1,580|I7,1,300|J7,280\nA8,general practitioners and family physicians|B8,605|C8,345|D8,260|E8,190|F8,105|G8,85|H8,245|I8,135|J8,110\nA9,psychologists|B9,265|C9,245|D9,20|E9,75|F9,80|G9,-5|H9,110|I9,120|J9,-10\nA10,social workers|B10,815|C10,735|D10,80|E10,395|F10,330|G10,65|H10,290|I10,230|J10,60\nA11,pharmacists|B11,360|C11,380|D11,-20|E11,165|F11,210|G11,-45|H11,115|I11,100|J11,15\nA12,licensed practical nurses|B12,995|C12,910|D12,85|E12,500|F12,460|G12,40|H12,360|I12,330|J12,30\nA13,paramedical occupations|B13,305|C13,435|D13,-130|E13,140|F13,220|G13,-80|H13,90|I13,100|J13,-10\nA14,nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates|B14,3,210|C14,2,665|D14,545|E14,1,890|F14,1,420|G14,470|H14,950|I14,950|J14,0\nA15,other health care professionals|B15,4,710|C15,4,090|D15,620|E15,1,710|F15,1,700|G15,10|H15,1,850|I15,1,450|J15,400\n<Merged Cells>B3:D3,A3:A5,B5:J5,H3:J3,E3:G3</Merged Cells></Sheet> Question:how many professionals who could potentially provide services counted in french in paramedics province in 2011?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
